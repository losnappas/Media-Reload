maybe do the ctrl+seek refresh first?	
	-refresh buffer with ctrl+click that is



structure:
	-workers?
		-new worker for every site*tab*?
			-workers don't use same memory space so could work?
	
	-other ideas...
		-start with ctrl click refresh addon?


ctrl click refresh addon:
	-fully reset buffer on ctrl click seek
	-seek to part
	-start buffering from there
	-customize button to reset? e.g. alt+click etc.


start off easy:
	-button to start or stop video playback
		-onclick -> log id or something
		-then do document.HTMLvid...etc.


fully functional ctrl clicker needs:
	-apparently content script to seek and background script to detect onclick?


to work on:
	-does mediaSource need to be toggled on at start or smtn?
	-sourcebuffer does who what now?
		-sourcebuffer.abort
	-in short: mediasource, sourcebuffer
	-HTMLMediaElement.captureStream--------------------------------//check this out


problem: can't unlisten ctrl+seeks. ~~ "fixed"
	why?
		new instance every time i sendMessage
			so can't detach


ideas for everyone:

make clear console addon
	press button->console.clear()
		clear on reload

make html 5 video player addon
	loop from second x to y
		additional menu to right click "loop" with '+' and '-' to 

bitcoin->eur right click menu thing like translate addon
